That’s why it’s so important for professionals and brands to have a strong LinkedIn content strategy in place. But crafting an effective LinkedIn content strategy is no walk in the park when you aim to reach a broad audience base.

                    In this article, we will provide you with some useful tips on developing an excellent LinkedIn content strategy. We’ll also address everything you need to do to make your personal LinkedIn profile and company page stand out.
                    
                    So whether you’re just starting with LinkedIn or looking to take your content strategy to the next level, read on. You’ll have a well-thought-out LinkedIn content strategy in place without wasting your time! 
                    
                    What Is a Content Strategy for LinkedIn?
                    A LinkedIn content strategy is a plan for creating and sharing content on LinkedIn that will help you achieve your business or personal goals. 
                    
                    When crafting your strategy, it is essential to consider what content will be most effective in achieving those goals. Will you be sharing blog posts? Writing articles? Posting updates? Creating videos? 
                    
                    It is also important to consider how often you’ll share new content. Once a day? A couple of times a week? Once a week? Depending on the goals of your strategy, the frequency of your postings may vary. 
                    
                    Plus, your LinkedIn content strategy must have your target audience at its heart. Who is your target audience? What kind of information are they looking for? What type of language will resonate with them? 
                    
                    By tailoring your content to your audience, you will be more likely to engage them and achieve your desired results. 
                    
                    Now that we’ve answered the question “What is a LinkedIn content strategy?”, let’s look at some native LinkedIn features that can help you implement yours.

                    LinkedIn Groups 
                    One of the best native features of many LinkedIn accounts is getting access to groups. Joining relevant groups on LinkedIn lets you connect with others in your industry who may be interested in your products or services. 
                    
                    Many groups also allow members to post updates and articles, providing yet another avenue for promoting your brand on LinkedIn.  
                    
                    LinkedIn Company Pages
                    LinkedIn Content Strategy: LinkedIn Company Pages
                    The easiest place to post LinkedIn content is your company page or personal profile. When you open your LinkedIn home page, you’ll find an option saying ‘start a post’ followed by the ‘write an article’ button. 
                    
                    If you post content using these buttons, it will show on your LinkedIn profile, and your followers can interact with it. For better reach and engagement, it is a good idea to share these posts with others and engage with them in the comments so that more and more LinkedIn users are engaged.
                    
                    LinkedIn Pulse 
                    LinkedIn Pulse allows users to write articles and post on the professional network.  These Pulse articles were allowed to reach up to 1,300 words in length, along with images, videos, and links. 
                    
                    Publishing an article on Pulse helped users show off their industry expertise and build credibility with other LinkedIn users. Unfortunately, this feature is no longer available – if you want to share long-form content on LinkedIn, you can post it directly from the ‘start a post’ tab instead of a separate feature.

                    Best Practices for Sharing Content on LinkedIn 
                    In addition to taking advantage of native features like Pulse and Groups, there are also some general best practices you should follow when sharing content on LinkedIn: 
                    
                    Make use of keywords so that your content appears in relevant searches. 
                    Use images, infographics, and videos whenever possible – visual content is more likely to catch someone’s eye as they scroll through their feed.
                    Keep Your posts short and sweet – readers are likelier to engage with something easy to digest.
                    Proofread everything before hitting “publish”– poor grammar and spelling errors reflect poorly on you or your company.
                    Always add value – if all you’re doing is trying to sell something, people will tune out quickly.
                    Use calls to action sparingly but effectively – too many calls to action can come across as pushy, but including one in your content can prompt people to learn more about your offer.
                    Monitor analytics to see what works well and tweak your strategy.
                    Take advantage of tools like Hootsuite Insights or Google Analytics for social media monitoring.
                    Try paid boosted posts or sponsored InMail messages if you’re having trouble getting organic reach.
                    How Does Content Strategy for LinkedIn Work?
                    As a business-oriented social media platform, LinkedIn is a great place to share content that will reach other professionals and thought leaders in your industry. 
                    
                    This LinkedIn content strategy overview will help you get started.
                    
                    Types of Content to Share on LinkedIn
                    When it comes to the types of content you can share on LinkedIn, the sky is the limit. That said, some types of content tend to perform better than others. Here are a few examples:
                    
                    Original blog posts: Share your original blog content on LinkedIn to drive traffic back to your website. Include a brief teaser and link back to your website so readers can easily find the full post.
                    Industry news articles: Sharing news articles related to your industry is a great way to show you’re up-to-date on the latest trends. When sharing news articles, include your commentary, so readers know why the article is significant.
                    LinkedIn Content Strategy: Industry news and articles
                    Infographics: People love infographics because they’re easy to consume and usually contain interesting information. If you have an infographic relevant to your industry, share it on LinkedIn along with a brief description of what it covers.
                    Slideshows: Slideshows are similar to infographics in that they’re easy to consume and usually contain useful information. If you have a slideshow relevant to your industry, you may want to share it with your LinkedIn connections. 
                    A solid LinkedIn content strategy has three main purposes: to build relationships, generate leads, and create a strong LinkedIn presence. Also, remember that each piece of content should have a different purpose. 
                    
                    For example, some posts might be designed to increase brand awareness, while others might be meant to nurture relationships with potential customers. It’s important to clearly understand your goals before creating any content. 
                    
                    Once you know what you want to achieve, you can create a strategy to help you reach your goals. A good LinkedIn content strategy will include a mix of different types of content, such as blog posts, articles, infographics, and videos. It’s also key to post regularly and vary the content types you share.ategy will include a mix of different types of content, such as blog posts, articles, infographics, and videos.
