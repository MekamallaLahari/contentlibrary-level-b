            <div class="content-card">
                <h3>facebook content stategy</h3>
                <p>In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company would be shifting focus to “meaningful social interactions.” This meant that people could expect to see “more (posts) from friends, family and groups” and “less public content like posts from businesses, brands and media.”

                    Since this change, it has gotten harder to find organic reach success. 
                    
                    But if you think ads can guarantee you engagement and shares, you’re mistaken. 
                    
                    The truth is: whether you’re putting out paid ads or organic posts, you’re not just competing with other brands but you’re also competing with posts from users’ friends and family. 
                    
                    One of the most effective ways to stand out and gain visibility in a crowded Facebook news feed is with the use of visuals in your social media strategy. 
                    
                    Let’s take a look at eight visual tactics to boost engagement and shares on your Facebook posts. 
                    
                    1. Show products in action
                    Using product-focused or lifestyle images to showcase your products might seem like a no-brainer but not everyone gets it right. 
                    
                    After all, most of the time you can’t post a product image against a white background and expect it to get traction. 
                    
                    The key lies in presenting your product in a manner that attracts attention and generates interest in the viewer. Here are some ways to style product shots:
                    
                    Focus on a single product against a contrasting background
                    
                    Use a lifestyle image or add a human element to show how the product is being used
                    
                    Do a flat lay by taking an aerial shot of the product(s)
                    
                    Use arrows or illustrations to highlight the features
                    
                    Take a look at this Facebook post by Allbirds. They’ve used a lifestyle image with a strong focus on the shoe, showing you what you need to see. 
                    
                    But what happens to brands selling intangible or digital products such as white papers, eBooks, online courses, insurance services or any others that customers can’t see?
                    
                    In such a scenario, it’s a good idea to visualize the tangible benefits of the product and demonstrate it through the imagery. You need to show the user how they will benefit from the product or how it will make them feel. 
                    
                    2. Use mini-infographics
                    From being attention-grabbing and memorable to engaging readers and making complex information easier to digest – infographics are valuable visual communication tools. 
                    
                    What’s more, they receive 3x more shares than any other type of content, making them an essential type of visual to include in your social media marketing plan. 
                    
                    But anyone who has seen infographics knows that the long ones can’t be posted as-is on Facebook because the size specifications will cause the infographic to be cropped abruptly.
                    
                    While promoting infographics on social media, break them down into smaller graphics. Doing this makes them more legible and striking, leading to an increase in engagement and shares.
                    
                    Here’s an example of a mini-infographic Venngage posted on Facebook. It’s a subset of the main infographic, focusing on a single point. 
                    
                    The link to the blog post with the main infographic is mentioned in the caption. We noticed a lot more clicks to that post because people seemed to want to know more about it after viewing a small section of it on Facebook. 
                    
                    3. Create recognizable memes
                    Spend a few minutes on social media and you’re sure to come across a meme or two. That’s how widespread and popular they have become. 
                    
                    Memes work because they are:
                    
                    Relatable 
                    
                    Engaging
                    
                    Shareable
                    
                    Due to this, it makes sense for brands to include memes in their Facebook content strategy to connect with their audience. 
                    
                    You can either repurpose existing memes by adding your branding or create original ones. The idea is to showcase your humorous side and convey the key message without coming across as offensive. 
                    
                    Here’s an example from Barkbox, relating to the feelings of many people in their audience who were starting to get tired of quarantine.
                    
                    4. Repurpose top content into visuals
                    Most marketers fail to realize that apart from new content creation, it’s also important to reflect on existing content assets and repurpose the top-performing ones for other distribution channels. 
                    
                    Apart from being a cost-effective strategy, this also helps you increase brand awareness and drive more engagement while boosting social media growth. 
                    
                    For instance, if a blog post is performing well, don’t just share the link on Facebook. Instead, look at how you can repurpose that post into social media visuals so that they manage to generate interest in users, enticing them to read the entire post on your blog. 
                    
                    Here are some tactics to identify posts for social media repurposing:
                    
                    Content that your audience is searching for
                    
                    Articles that generate the most shares on social media
                    
                    Articles that drive the most traffic to your website
                    
                    Content assets that convert readers into customers
                    
                    Here’s an example of how Venngage repurposed a blog post on marketing plans into a crisp social media infographic, outlining the essential elements. 
                    
                    5. Create snackable videos
                    From landing pages and email newsletters to blog posts and social media – videos are a favorite across channels.
                    
                    But with almost every brand creating videos today, how do you design one that gets noticed and generates engagement? Here are a few Facebook video creation tips to succeed: 
                    
                    Keep videos short and to-the-point (the optimal video length is 1 minute, 30 seconds)
                    
                    Create high-quality videos 
                    
                    Include the key message or capture attention in the first few seconds
                    
                    Consider posting vertical videos that are optimized for mobile viewing
                    
                    Design an enticing thumbnail that attracts clicks
                    
                    An example of a brand that does Facebook videos well is the Dollar Shave Club. Their videos are fun and slick.
                    
                    
                    
                    6. Leverage user-generated content
                    You might think user-generated content is best suited for Instagram but that’s not true. 
                    
                    According to a survey, consumers found user-generated content to be 9.8x more impactful than influencer content during the purchasing process.
                    
                    This goes to prove how powerful user-generated content is. At a time when people are bombarded with ads and marketing messages, user-generated content adds an element of authenticity and credibility, thereby leading to higher engagement and social shares.
                    
                    Here are some ways to integrate user-generated content into your Facebook content strategy:
                    
                    Curate and re-share them on your feed
                    
                    Create visuals highlighting user reviews and testimonials
                    
                    Include them in your Facebook ads
                    
                    Create multi-image posts or an album featuring a collection of user-generated content posts
                    
                    Create video montages with the user-generated content
                    
                    Be sure to seek the original user’s permission before you use their posts. It’s also a good idea to tag them while sharing their content on your page. 
                    
                    One of the most effective ways to gather user-generated content is by hosting a Facebook contest and incentivizing people to share original content featuring your brand. 
                    
                    Loews Hotels’ Facebook posts often feature user-generated content. Notice how they add a relevant caption to the post while tagging the original creator. 
                    
                    7. Use contrasting colors and fonts
                    A huge part of posting enticing visuals lies in using the right colors and fonts. After all, there’s no way a Facebook post with a distracting color scheme or illegible font can grab attention. 
                    
                    The team at Venngage recently compiled the top graphic design trends that will dominate 2021. As per the findings, muted color palettes work well because they make graphics feel more authentic and natural. 
                    
                    Similarly, if your visual includes text, use classic and simple fonts that are easy to read and appropriately sized. 
                    
                    As social media posts are generally viewed on smaller screens, make sure you don’t use too many types of fonts as that will end up crowding the image and confusing the reader. 
                    
                    Take a look at this Facebook post by Socialbakers (now Emplifi Social Marketing Cloud). The blue bubbles stand out against the yellow background and convey the information clearly. 
                    
                    8. Maintain brand consistency
                    With the number of posts vying for attention on the Facebook news feed, brands with a consistent look and feel certainly stand out and appeal to their target audience. 
                    
                    This is why it’s very important to maintain visual brand consistency on social media. Use your brand’s color, fonts, and aesthetics while designing social media visuals. Doing this will help you establish a memorable presence and enhance recall value. 
                    
                    Take a look at Salesforce’s posts -- they are all in line with their brand colors (white and blue). Some of them also include their brand mascots, making them instantly recognizable. 
                    
                    The takeaway
                    It’s safe to say that the difference between a Facebook post that gets engagement and one that doesn’t is the use of powerful visuals. 
                    
                    These visual content tactics will help you boost your Facebook content strategy and create posts that spark conversations and entice people to engage with your brand.

                <h3>Facebook Engagement Tips</h3>
                <p>One of the main components of any social media strategy is increasing your overall social media engagement—and the same goes for Facebook. If you’re promoting your business and its products or services on Facebook, you want your target audience to engage with your content.

                    However, increasing your Facebook engagement can be tricky. You need to know the right strategies to implement and how to get started.
                    
                    Throughout this article, learn more about what Facebook engagement means, how to calculate your Facebook engagement rate and 13 key strategies for improving engagement on Facebook.
                    
            What is Facebook engagement?
            Facebook engagement refers to any action that a Facebook user takes on your Facebook page—mainly likes, comments, shares and clicks. Increasing the number of engagements you see like this on your page proves that your Facebook marketing strategy is working and that your content resonates well with your audience.
            
            How to calculate your Facebook engagement rate
            You can calculate your Facebook engagement rate with a simple formula:
            
            Facebook Engagement Rate = [(Total Likes + Comments + Shares)/Total Reach] x 100
            
            You can find these metrics via Facebook insights or by using a third-party Facebook analytics tool. In your Facebook page dashboard, you can get a quick overview and grab your numbers from the “Post reach” and “Interactions” sections in order to discover your Facebook engagement rate.

            1. Understand your target audience
Knowing who you’re trying to target with your content can help better inform your strategy, direct your messaging and ensure your content resonates with those your business can help the most.

Start by getting a basic understanding of social media user demographics so you know who is on each platform you market on. For example, we can see that Facebook’s basic demographics look like this:

Make sure this lines up with your business’s basic demographics. But then look even further. Who does your business help with its products or services?

For example, if you’re trying to reach men in their 30s, you should:

Make sure they’re on your platform of choice (in this case, you’re in the clear)
Create a strategy that caters to that audience
Keep them in mind when you’re writing your content
2. Know the best times to post on Facebook
The more engagement a post receives, the more likely Facebook’s algorithm is to reward it with reach. This might seem a bit backward but it speaks to the importance of timing your posts to perfection.

By posting when your followers are most active, you instantly increase the likelihood of getting likes and comments.

And yes, there are data-driven best times to post on social media which can clue you in on what your posting calendar should look like.

The key here is to not just post at random and expect engagement. With the help of the chart below and analyzing your past post engagement, you can zero in on a schedule that makes sense.

Based on Sprout Social data, a graph of data that gives me the best times to post on Facebook up to the world level in 2024.
We recommend using a Facebook scheduling tool to plan your social media calendar days or weeks in advance. It’ll keep you from forgetting to post and give you the flexibility to test different posting times.

Plus, by taking advantage of Sprout Social, you can discover optimal times for your specific brand to publish, rather than relying on global data. Just simply use the “Optimal Send Times” dropdown to see when Sprout’s AI recommends you share your posts.

3. Post consistently
While the next post talking about quality is just as important, you also need to post consistently. While global data showcases that some brands post around 4-5 times per day on Facebook, that’s a lot of content to share and also remain consistent.

What you need to do is figure out how many times your team can reasonably post each day or each week—and do so consistently. Consistent content creation increases your likelihood of appeasing the algorithm and getting your content seen by more people.

If you’re posting on a consistent and reliable basis, you’re on the right track.

4. Focus on quality content
Next, make sure your content is engaging, fun and quality to increase the chances that your audience interacts with your content. In this endeavor, many brands make the mistake of putting themselves in a box when it comes to their content.

Let’s say you’re running a Facebook page for your sandwich shop. Should you exclusively post content related to sandwiches?

Of course not.

For starters, there’s only so much that can really be said on a day-to-day basis about your brand or product. As soon as your content starts to feel repetitive or stale, your audience will tune out.

Here’s some food for thought: your Facebook content isn’t all about you. It’s about your audience. They might like you, but that doesn’t mean they only want to hear about you all day long. Once you start to embed that idea into your strategy, increasing Facebook engagement becomes much more realistic.

And if you’re struggling to find ideas for fresh content, you can start by asking yourself a few questions.

What’s trending?
Pulling from pop culture and current events is a smart move if done tastefully. Check out how HubSpot put out an awesome post to coincide with Valentine’s Day.

Do you have any fun facts?
Infographics and shocking statistics are prime for discussion and debate, both of which are huge pieces of Facebook engagement. Activity in the comment sections spells good news to the updated algorithm.

Have you shown off your brand’s personality?
Like it or not, Facebook has become a hotbed for memes and humorous content. Although humor might not be the perfect fit for every brand, funny content typically performs well and is a lighthearted way to diversify your posts.

It might be tempting to simply talk about yourself, but that’s not going to drive much engagement. Strive to stick to the common rule of content curation that says only 20% of what you post should be self-promotional.

Besides, filling your feed with a variety of content will always keep your followers looking forward to what’s next.

Oh, and if you want to have instant access to fresh pieces your audience will love, tools such as content suggestions from Sprout can do the digging so you don’t have to.

5. Respond to your customers
Improving your Facebook page engagement isn’t a “one and done” affair. If someone takes the time to comment on your content, make sure you’re taking the time to respond.

People overwhelmingly want to interact with brands, which is the reason why so many businesses that reply to comments score more interactions.

If nothing else, taking the time to reply to fans shows that you’re listening to them. This is a good look from a branding perspective and also encourages more interaction among fans in the future.

If you don’t have time to respond to each and every inbound message, you can create a Facebook chatbot to do so for you, or use a third-party messaging tool to keep all of your social media messages in one easy-to-organize place.

6. Improve your use of images and video
Visual content totally crushes it on Facebook—plain and simple—and Facebook isn’t shy about how much they love video content on their platform.

Other than links, photos and videos are one of the most common post types on the platform, signaling that people would much rather engage with a visual than a wall of text. So if you want to improve Facebook engagement, get visual.

However, the type of images and videos you post make a massive difference in terms of performance.

Many budding businesses make the mistake of relying on stock photos or videos pulled from elsewhere rather than creating their own content.

Instead, brands should strive to show the personality behind their business. There’s a reason why photos “in the wild” are so popular from big brands, as are stories from employees.

After all, it’s the social network, not the stock photo network.

Also, keep in mind that images can be powerful tools to encourage serial scrollers to stop in their tracks and look at your posts. Images containing striking colors and stunning landscapes typically do well, as evidenced by brands like GoPro who kill it with their photo content.

In addition, Facebook encourages brands to upload videos—rather than share video URLs—to drive discussion among their followers.

This means simply copy-and-pasting a link to your recent YouTube video as a post isn’t going to cut it.

Instead, brands should upload and publish videos within their Facebook posts whenever possible. Whether it’s animations, commercials or jumping on Facebook Live, regularly publishing video content on Facebook is a smart move supported by the platform itself.

7. Consider user-generated content
User-generated content, or UGC, is content that is created by your audience that you then share on your own feed. This type of content is highly engaging and fun for your audience to see their own content shared by a brand they love.

If your audience hasn’t given you any UGC to choose from, there are a few strategies you can use to change that.

First, put out an ask. Make a post asking people to share photos or videos of your products. Consider gamifying it or turning it into a contest where you randomly select a winner out of the people who commented or messaged you with their UGC and provide them with a gift card or free product.

Second, consider hiring a UGC creator. This is different from an influencer as it’s someone who is hired specifically to make content for your brand to share on its page, rather than promote your brand to their own followers. This can be a great way to start off your UGC journey even if it’s not quite as authentic as the real thing.

8. Use Facebook analytics to inform your strategy
Sometimes the key to increasing Facebook engagement is to look inward.

Let’s say you have a post that knocks it out of the park. Tons of likes and shares, and plenty of love in the comment section.

Rather than treat that post as an anomaly, you should instead take steps to recreate the same social magic again.

Maybe it was an unexpected meme. Perhaps it was an epic case study.

Either way, you should have a pulse on your top-performing content instead of playing guessing games. Again, your fans’ activity is key to understanding what to post.

To better break down that activity, take a close look at your Facebook analytics to see firsthand what’s receiving the most reach. The answer might very well surprise you.

9. Leverage employee advocacy
Instead of solely relying on your brand page to share your latest content, why not ask your employees to do some of the heavy lifting?</p>
