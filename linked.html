                <h3>LinkedIn Content Strategy</h3>
                <p>Learn how to create a compelling LinkedIn content strategy that drives engagement and builds your professional network.LinkedIn  is a business and employment-focused social media platform that works through websites and mobile apps. It was launched on May 5, 2003 by Reid Hoffman and Eric Ly. Since December 2016, LinkedIn has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.The platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and allows jobseekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015, most of the company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.[8] LinkedIn has more than 1 billion registered members from over 200 countries and territories.

                    LinkedIn allows members (both employees and employers) to create profiles and connect with each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn can also be used to organize offline events, join groups, write articles, publish job postings, post photos and videos, and more.</p>

                <h3>LinkedIn Engagement Tips</h3>
                <p>Explore effective tips to increase engagement on your LinkedIn posts, including best times to post and typesHow to Increase Engagement on Your LinkedIn Page
                    1. Incorporate videos
                    You can upload videos and even host LinkedIn Live Events from your LinkedIn Page quite easily, and the results are well worth it. Video posts get 5x as much engagement on LinkedIn as conventional posts, and Live Video posts get 24x more engagement. 
                    To make the most of your videos, keep these tips and best practices in mind:
                    Plan for mobile viewing: Up to 91% of LinkedIn members watch videos on their mobile devices. If the video you’re creating doesn’t require landscape format, consider shooting it vertically instead.
                    Always include subtitles: LinkedIn research shows that only around a third of people watching videos on mobile have the sound on at the time.
                    Show what you want to show in the first ten seconds: You only have around that long to grab your audience’s attention.
                    Optimize video length to match your goal: LinkedIn studies show that less than 30 seconds is ideal for brand awareness and consideration goals, whereas demand gen videos can be slightly longer and tell a more complex story.
                    Use an informative and engaging thumbnail: This will help your viewers see what your video is about at a glance.
