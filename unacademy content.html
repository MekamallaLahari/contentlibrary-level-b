                    Activities
                    During the pandemic in 2020, Unacademy opened its platform to schools and colleges to conduct live classes for their students.[23]
                    In the same year, the company launched its Legends on Unacademy, an initiative to bring together known personalities from different walks of life such as sports, arts, business, leadership and conducts curated lessons on their subject of expertise and life lessons.

                    In May 2021, Unacademy launched Educate India, an initiative supported by Feeding India, that provided free 1-year subscriptions to 10,000 children.[26]

                    Criticism
                    In January 2020, Unacademy suffered a data leak by the hacker group ShinyHunters that led to the exposure of personal data of nearly 22 million users. The breach included user records of employees from Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC, SBI, Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro, Accenture, Facebook and Google, among others.[30] The records appeared for sale on a dark web forum, with the seller asking for $2000. Unacademy officials later confirmed that nearly 11 million accounts were compromised, but nothing valuable was leaked or misused. Unacademy re-assured the fact that no sensitive information has been compromised in their official statement on the issue.[31][32]
                    
                    In May 2021, it was criticized for posting questions in their Test Series that were religiously inclined and were claimed to be anti-national in nature. Learners complain that often their educators are removed from the system, leaving the syllabus mid-way. Recently,[when?] Unacademy was under scrutiny for laying off both educators as well as full-time employees.[33][34][35]
                    
                    Brajesh Maheshwari who is the co-founder and director of Allen Career Institute threatened its teachers of leaving the institute and moving to the other offline coaching centres after Unacademy opened a coaching centre in Kota and had roped in several teachers from Allen. He also stated that Allen Career Institute will not accept the teacher back into the institute if they leave the institute in the first place to join other institute like Unacademy and Physicswallah[36] Unacademy also suspended contracts of educators to cut cost due to funding winter in July 2022.[37]

PrepLadder
In 2021, Sri Lankan company Medical Joyworks filed a suit in the Bombay Civil Court alleging that PrepLadder, a subsidiary of Unacademy, has plagiarized Medical Joyworks' Prognosis application and other property.[14] The court in its order on 20 September 2021 stated that "Unacademy cannot use its PrepLadder app, website and any other content until all proprietary information, know-how, and technology belonging to Medical Joyworks have been removed to the satisfaction of Medical Joyworks and an independent auditor."[38]

However, on 24 September 2021, the Bombay High Court stayed this judgement when the legal counsel appearing for PrepLadder alleged that the civil court's order was completely erroneous since the civil judge had passed it without jurisdiction.[39]

'Vote for educated' leaders controversy
On 17 August 2023 Unacademy fired Karan Sangwan, a teacher, after a video of him urging students to not vote for those who only focus on changing names, and to elect well-educated politicians, went viral on 14 August.[40] Roman Saini, Unacademy cofounder defended his removal by pointing that classroom is not a place to share personal opinions and views. He further noted that platform was forced to do so.[41][42][43] Reacting, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal questioned if it is a crime to ask people to vote for educated people. Supriya Shrinate wrote: “Sad to see such spineless and weak people run an education platform.
